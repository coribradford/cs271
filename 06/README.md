### To run the assembler:
Open a command window and invoke the assembler.
It is found in the project 6 folder, and is called at the command line as "assembler.py"
Follow this with the file to be translated (either the full path or relative to the folder the assembler is in), on the same line, as an argument for 
the function. Just "running" the program will result in an index error, as the argument cannot be passed into the function this way.
